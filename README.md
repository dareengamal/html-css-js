Implement an interactive image gallery: The image gallery should display a set of images and allow users to navigate through them using previous and next buttons. Additionally, users should be able to view image details and descriptions when they click on an image
 
Requirements:
Create an HTML file and include the necessary elements to structure the page, such as a header, image container, navigation buttons, and image details section.
Style the image gallery using CSS to make it visually appealing. Apply appropriate styles to the header, image container, navigation buttons, and image details section.
Implement JavaScript functionality to display the images and handle user interactions.
Create an array of image objects in JavaScript, where each object represents an image and includes properties like image URL, title, and description.
Use JavaScript to dynamically generate the image elements and insert them into the image container. Each image element should include an image source, title, and description.
Implement navigation functionality using JavaScript to allow users to move to the previous and next images in the gallery. When the user reaches the first or last image, the navigation buttons should loop back to the opposite end.
Add event listeners to the image elements, so when a user clicks on an image, the image details (title and description) are displayed in the image details section.
Style the image details section using CSS to ensure it is visually appealing and properly positioned on the page.
Apply appropriate transitions and animations using CSS and JavaScript to enhance the user experience when navigating through images or displaying image details.
Test the image gallery in different browsers and ensure it is responsive and works well on various devices (desktop, tablets, mobile).
